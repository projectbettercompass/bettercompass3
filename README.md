## BetterCompass 3.0 is here!
BetterCompass is a frontend client for the Compass.Education school manager written in Python using Flask.

BetterCompass offers a plethora of advanced features to improve your Compass experience. We currently have a better news, tasks and timetable page as well as a page to view your reports and see the staff in your school.

This project is no longer affiliated with Troplo's BetterCompass or Mapler.
